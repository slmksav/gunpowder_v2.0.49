# gunpowder_v2.0.49
An updated and tweaked version of ewewukek's musket mod for Fabric 0.11.1 MC 1.9.2

- Mod and all it's features set up-to-date to be compatible with the latest version of the game
- Ballistics of all weapons have been tweaked to better represent softbore (non-rifled) gunpowder weaponry
- Increased the reloading time three-fold to balance out the role of ranged weapons in combat
- Added a new weapon, the Hunting Musket, which is less accurate but more deadly and meant for close range
